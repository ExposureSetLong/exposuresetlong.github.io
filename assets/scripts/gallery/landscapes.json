Even though it was not the prettiest of the sunsets, there were still some colors in the skies that I was able to accentuate in this 296 seconds #LongExposurePhotography.\n\nI also bumped into #BlackGlassGallery and had a fun conversation revolving photography.\n\nExif: #Canon #5DMarkIII - Canon 24-105 F/4L - 296 seconds using #Nisi #BigStopper - F/10 - ISO 200 - 24mm\n\n#Brooklyn #NewYork #BGGMeetup #NewYorkCity #Sunset #BrooklynPiers #Piers #FreedomTower #1WTC"
